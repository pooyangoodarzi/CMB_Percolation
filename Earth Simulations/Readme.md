This is the simulation based on the paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.00256 done by Jingfang Fan, Jun Meng, Abbas Ali Saberi. The study is about exploring the elevations of earth as a network, using percolation. The writers found out that the network has remarkable feature which is explained by the theory of critical phenomena and phase transitions. they show that the network has an explosive percolation which i will explain a bit more later on. the idea is simple assume the earth has no water on it then if I start to put water on it little by little and each time I calculate the biggest cluster of joint waters I can see that there exist a specific hight where there exist the biggest possible cluster of waters. we can do this process in reverse as well, if I fill the earth with water to the point that there exist no land and then little by little I take out the water and calculate the biggest cluster of land then again there exist a hight where we can see the biggest land cluster. in this critical hight if I take a little more water then there would be a lot of land and if I put on a little more water I will lose many land. the authors show that this critical hight is the see level right now on earth. me and my college (pooyan) wrote the code together to redrive the paper's results.
